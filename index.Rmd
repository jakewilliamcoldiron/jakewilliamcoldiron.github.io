I am Jake William Coldiron, a statistician, researcher, and director specializing in the development and application of statistical methods to complex datasets. My focus lies in longitudinal data analysis, machine learning, and model validation to find hidden structures, enhance predictive accuracy, and support data-driven decision-making. Through a balance of directing ambitious studies and performing statistical analysis, I do my best to find the correct balance of theory and reality.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Biostatistics at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Prior to Columbia, I earned Bachelor of Science from Georgia State University, double minoring in Mathematics and Sociology. During these years, I led initiatives in computational methods, public health program evaluation, and statistical education and beyond into mentorship, academic service, and collaboration with industry in biostatistics.

## Research

My research interests span multiple domains, including causal inference, survival analysis, Bayesian methods, and computational biostatistics. I am particularly interested in using machine learning and predictive modeling and regression to enhance decision-making in public health and medicine. 

Currently, I am leading research efforts at Voices of Atrial Fibrillation Patients (VoAFP), where I oversee study design, data analysis, and methodological development to improve patient-centered outcomes in atrial fibrillation care. My work also involves integrating patient-reported data with structured clinical datasets to enhance our understanding of disease progression and treatment efficacy.

Additionally, my research contributions include published manuscripts on maternal and child health, contraceptive access, and infectious disease epidemiology. I continue to engage in collaborative projects that utilize innovative statistical methods to address pressing public health challenges.

## Work

Throughout my career, I have balanced academic research with professional roles in leadership, healthcare analytics, and statistical consulting. As the Research Director at VoAFP, I develop strategic plans, oversee data partnerships, and implement advanced statistical models to drive impactful research. Prior to this, I worked as a research assistant at Georgia State University and contributed to health policy research at the Georgia Health Policy Center. My experience also includes hands-on roles in clinical operations, legal compliance, and regulatory adherence.

In addition to my research and professional work, I actively contribute to the academic community through invited talks, university workshops, and mentorship programs. I have delivered presentations at major conferences, including the American Public Health Association (APHA) Annual Conference, and have provided training on biostatistical methods, GIS applications, and computational techniques.

Through a commitment to rigorous statistical methodology and interdisciplinary collaboration, I strive to advance the role of biostatistics in shaping evidence-based policies, improving healthcare delivery, and driving innovation in research.

## Out of Office

Beyond research, I spend my time outdoors and playing sports. I spend most of my free time playing badminton, but also find time for  tennis, ping pong, and soccer. When I'm not on the court or in the gym, I am an avid backpacker eager to explore new trails. These activities keep me active and provide a great way to unwind, challenge myself, and connect with others who share similar interests.
