# Notice

### Thank you for visiting! This website is still under construction with significant portions of the infrasture coming from [Jeff Goldsmith](https://jeffgoldsmith.com/) but all important external links (e.g., CV, ResearchGate, ORCiD, and LinkedIn) are working. The website will be completed by the end of August 2024, so come back then!  

## Introduction 

Jake William Coldiron is a rising young professional in global and public health. He completed a Bachelor of Science in Public Health (BSPH) with minors in Mathematics and Sociology at Georgia State University, as well as EMT Certification at the Grady EMS Academy. In addition to his education, Jake W. Coldiron worked at two positions within the Georgia State University School of Public Health. At his first position, he assisted the university's COVID response by creating physical and digital informational media and speaks to students about COVID, COVID safety, and vaccines. At his second position, he worked as a research assistant for an NIH-funded study conducting interviews, statistical analyses, and manuscript preparation. 

Finally, he continues to serve as a poll manager with a particular emphasis on helping English-limited or Spanish-only voters. His three main areas of interest are biostatistics, perinatal transmission of disease, and chronic infectious diseases ultimately aims to serve as both a researcher and clinician. In Jake's free time, he volunteers as a local scouting leader and trainer.

#### Research

For several years, I have worked to advance the state-of-the-art in functional data analysis by developing methods for understanding patterns in large, complex datasets in neuroscience, physical activity monitoring, and other areas. 

Working closely with clinicians and neuroscientists around the world, my collaborators and I have focused on improving the understanding skilled movements. This work involves reaching movements made by stroke patients: in these experiments, a patient's fingertip position is recorded hundreds of time per second for the duration of the reach. I have developed new statistical methods to understand the impact of stroke on movement quality, and applied these to large, longitudinal datasets. In parallel, I have proposed methods for wearable device research, especially focusing on accelerometers. These devices can produce minute-by-minute (or even finer) resolution observations of activity for hundreds of participants over several days, weeks, or months. The methods developed include approaches for regression with activity trajectories as outcomes; for interpretable dimension reduction; and for aligning major patterns (like wake from sleep, mid-day dips in activity, and sleep onset) across subjects. 

#### Data science

Data science is a newly-formed and, as yet, loosely-defined discipline that has nonetheless emerged as a critical component of successful research in biostatistics and public health. I work to incorporate data science techniques for transparency and reproducibility into biostatistical analyses. Research projects are accompanied by robust, publicly available software and analytical pipelines that ensure the reproducibility of the results. This approach is informed by my work in developing a graduate course in [data science](https://p8105.com).

#### About

I received a BS in mathematics from [Dickinson College](http://www.dickinson.edu) in 2007 and a PhD in Biostatistics from [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) in 2012. My dissertation was advised by [Ciprian Crainiceanu](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ccrainic/) and [Brian Caffo](https://sites.google.com/view/bcaffo/home), and focused on statistical methods for high-dimensional structured data. I joined Columbia as an assistant professor in 2012.

In 2013, I founded (with [Todd Ogden](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/to166) and [Phil Reiss](https://works.bepress.com/phil_reiss/)) the Functional Data Analysis Working Group ([FDAWG](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/functional-data-analysis-working-group)) at Columbia Biostat.
